# basic scripts

stack a sequence of commands

## executable file

will come back to this with pyinstaller library. book was written with linux in mind

## passing arguments

- `from sys import argv` in file
- `python main.py arg1` in term

this means argv returns
`['main.py', 'arg1']`

## user input

use `input()` to gather user input from terminal
if message inside () like `input('enter a number')` then 'enter a number will show in terminal.
